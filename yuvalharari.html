				<h1 style="color:black;font-size:20px;">Sapiens & Homo Deus</h1>
         <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">Yuval Harari brings an interesting perspective to the table, one that is not often used in the context of talking about technological and cultural advances of the future. Rather than prophesying based on scientific and engineering thought, he chooses to drag the reader through the historical diversity of the past to try and predict human nature of the future. Each historical anecdote brings into the question the validity of our modern day perception of morals, political thought, and religious dogma (i.e., deism, humanism and dataism). He did this in Sapiens, but I found Homo Deus to be much more intense emotion roller coaster due to his attempt to scare the reader about with his opinions on the nonlinear (and sometimes absurd) effects of technology. <br/><br/>

It seemed as though Harari wrote both books with a couple of underlying agendas that steered his ideas (particularly those in Homo Deus) in a negative direction. One of the underlying themes I noticed in both books was Harari's seemingly antagonistic views on the modern culture of the human race. In both books he iterates on the work-life balance of our primitive hunter/gatherer ancestors compared to the lifestyle of modern-day individuals. A hunter/gatherer focused on the procurement of food for a portion of the day, but did whatever they pleased with their remaining time. In contrast, a factory worker in China would work grueling hours in terrible conditions for the entirety of their lives with significantly lower living standards than their primitive ancestors. Even in fully developed societies, the work ethic far outpaces our ancestors’ lives and the fruit of our labor introduces problems that even generations a few years back could not even comprehend. This idea begs the question, is future innovation really taking us on the right path? The second theme that was heavily focused on in Homo Deus was animal rights. He points out the inhumane treatment of our livestock in graphic terms. Although very convincing, Harari paints a future in which technology outpaces the human mind through artificial intelligence, only to eventually treat our race just as we treat the intelligences on this earth that we see inferior to ourselves.<br/><br/>

With both of these narratives in Harari's arsenal, Homo Deus begins to pick and tear apart everything that anyone could possibly believe in, everything from political beliefs and social contracts to religion and purpose of life. The first section of the book walks through the death of Deism. He argues that many on earth may still believe in a deity, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that it isn’t already dead, just that the body still needs to thrown out. The second part of the book focused on the rise of Humanism in Deism’s place. Many religions today incorporate the philosophies of Humanism, but Yuval does an excellent job at converting everyone else who not on board yet. But once he has you on the bandwagon, he hangs Humanism by the neck until the reader’s perception on the world is drowned in overwhelming nihilism. This makes way for Yuval Harari’s forcast of the future: Dataism. This new religion is the blend of technology, AI and the human race. The final goal is to upgrade the homo sapien to homo deus. And yet, as glorious as it should sound, Harari uses historical anecdotes to convince the reader that this belief is just as momentary and meaningless as every belief system in the history of Sapiens. The book finishes with dulled sense of reality, and reader is left to trudge through dark world that no longer has hope and meaning.<br/><br/>

With all of that negativity out of the way, the book really does bring new and interesting thoughts to the table. I have had many interesting conversations amongst my peers about this book, and Harari has definitely changed the way I see the world. But I would not say that I came out becoming a better, or even happier person. Yuval Harari delivered everything I could have wanted in an intellectual read, but at the time it cost me part of my humanity.<br/><br/></p>
